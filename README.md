# AWS MULTI TIER ARCHITECTURE USING TERRAFORM
## This guide outlines the step-by-step deployment of a scalable and secure multi-tier architecture on AWS using Terraform. This approach leverages Infrastructure as Code to automate cloud infrastructure provisioning and minimize manual errors.
âœ… Core AWS Services Used
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) for running the application instances using launch templates.

1.Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

                To isolate network infrastructure with CIDR-based subnetting.
2.Subnets

                Public and private subnets for routing and tier separation.
3.Internet Gateway
 
                To allow internet access to instances in public subnets.
4.Route Tables

                For managing traffic routing within the VPC.
5.Application Load Balancer (ALB)

                For distributing HTTP traffic to backend instances.
6.Auto Scaling Group (ASG)

               For managing the number of EC2 instances dynamically based on traffic/load.
7.Launch Template

                Predefined configuration to consistently launch EC2 instances.
8.Security Groups

                Virtual firewalls to control inbound and outbound traffic to resources
9.Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

                 For running the application instances using launch templates.
10.Terraform

                  For provisioning, managing, and automating the entire AWS infrastructure
## Step 1: Selecting the AWS Region

The AWS region is the geographical location where your resources are hosted. A well-chosen region ensures low latency, regulatory compliance, and service availability.
Deployed In: us-east-1 (Northern Virginia)

## Step 2: Creating the Virtual Private Cloud
 VPC is set up as the isolated networking layer for all AWS resources.
VPC Configuration:
CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16
Features: DNS support and DNS hostnames enabled
This isolated network enables full control over networking and security.

## Step 3: Designing Subnets for Tiered Architecture
The VPC is divided into two availability zones subnets to main high availability
Public Subnets (for load balancer and jump boxes):

AZ-a: 10.0.1.0/24

AZ-b: 10.0.2.0/24

Private Subnets (for backend and database tiers):

AZ-a: 10.0.3.0/24, 10.0.5.0/24

AZ-b: 10.0.4.0/24, 10.0.6.0/24
## Step 4: Configuring Internet Access
An Internet Gateway is created and linked to the VPC for outbound internet access from public subnets.

Routing Setup:

Public route table has IGW route
Private subnets have internal routing only

Optional: Introduce NAT Gateway for private subnet internet access. In this case we are not using any.
## Step 5: Load Balancer Implementation

An ALB is deployed to handle HTTP traffic and direct it to backend servers hosted in private subnets.

ALB Setup:
Listens on HTTP port 80
Registers instances via target group
Exposes DNS for frontend users
## Step 6: Setting up Auto Scaling Group
ASG ensures continuous availability by automatically launching or terminating instances.

Configuration:

Launch template specifies AMI, instance type, user data

Health checks determine instance replacement

Integrated with target group of ALB
## Step 7: Launch Template and Bootstrapping

Launch template includes a shell script that configures the EC2 instance on boot.use script.sh file to load user data

##Step 8: Terraform Project Structure

Terraform scripts are organized for clarity and modularization.

Key Files:

main.tf: Resource composition

vpc.tf: Network resources

alb.tf: Load balancer and listeners

asg.tf: Auto Scaling configuration

launch_template.tf: Instance launch template

variables.tf: Input definitions

outputs.tf: Resulting outputs (e.g., ALB DNS)

provider.tf: AWS region and authentication

## Final Notes

Security: Least privilege principles applied using security groups

Scalability: ASG adjusts to traffic demands

Automation: Complete provisioning via Terraform enhances DevOps practices

Extensions: Add RDS MySQL/Aurora, NAT Gateway, Bastion host, and monitoring

##Summary

This project demonstrates a production-ready 3-tier AWS environment built entirely through Terraform. The architecture provides flexibility, automation, and resilience suitable for modern application workloads.
